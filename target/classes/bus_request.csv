Other,,Bengaluru,,,,"Extend present service of volvo AC bus: Most of the volvo buses those commutes via KR Puram have destination only till hebbala fly over.  I have seen people who are working in ITPL, Manyatha techpark and  other locations in this stretch will be struggling to get the buses to reach places like MAthikere, BEL circle yeshwanthpur, Peenya and gorgunte palya. People who are working in these locations like ITPL and manyatha techpark have to catch atleast two  buses to reach yeshwanthpur and it will take lot of time, hence most the people will either come by their own vehicle or they will try to catch private cabs by compromising with their safety as ordinary buses will be too crowded especially in the evening.

Dear Planners, 

Request you to implement a direct bus from koramangala to E-City & Viceversa.

2. Will reduce the traffic from roads
3. Will help patients to reach directly to Narayan Health.

New Route,,Bengaluru,Yelahanka Satelite Town (towards TOWARDS YELAHANKA TOWN),ITPL (towards I.T.P.L.),,"Dear Sir / Madam,

Yelahanka is one of the most prominent areas in North Bangalore. The population in and around Yelahanka is growing rapidly nowadays. But there is no bus service available to go to East and South Bangalore areas via Outer Ring Road. 

Currently we need to come to Hebbal bus stop by using city side buses and then we have to cross the railway track to reach Outer Ring Road. Finally we have to wait to catch other buses. This entire process takes 45 minutes to 1 hour depends upon Esteem mall traffic for every person.
 
So I request you to create two new bus routes (Volvo or Ordinary) from Yelahanka to Electronic City and Whitefield via Airport road to reach below areas: 
Hebbal ORR bus stop, Manyata Tech Park, Hennur, Kalyan Nagar, Ramamurthy Nagar, Tin factory,  KR Puram Railway Station, Marathahalli, JP Morgan, New Horizon College(Embassy Tech Village), Eco Space, Bellandur, HSR Layout, Silk board, (BTM Layout- Jayanagar-JP Nagar), (Bommanahalli - Electronic city), (Hoody Signal- IGATE bus stop- Vaidehi Hospital- ITPL).

I believe that these roots will definitely replace many cars from Airport road and Outer ring road (Mainly from Whitefield and Electronic city employees) every day and it will help to reduce the pollution in main junctions.

Please consider my suggestions and announce the new routes. 

Thank you in advance.

Thanks and Regards,
Kaviarasu Raman.

But it is not sufficient for commuters,as we have 100 of passengers lined up for same bus.

Also please note that there are hundreds of IT employees who will waiting for same bus and since there is scarcity of the buses which is encouraging them to board private buses and vehicles.

So could you please look in to the issue by allocating additional Volvo buses from ITPL to YPR at least during peak hours that is 6 to 8 PM.

Hope the above request will be considered at priority,if required BMTC officials can do spot inspection at  ASCENDS PARK SQUARE Mall ITPL.

Other,,Bengaluru,,,,"Please restore routes 44 and 188 - both these have been off road for over a year now. Very popular among daily commuters and office goers. With an increase in routes to KR market and KBS and less frequency of these 2, commuters probably chose to change buses, though direct ones would be preferable. Many a times, drivers of these 2 routes used to either skip stops or stop far away from bus stops. Also it was noted that few conductors used to recycle tickets and not issue any tickets to short journey commuters despite several requests from commuters, which led to decreased collection. This was a routine in route 188. 
One of the four buses currently plying on route 43E and one of several 43B could be converted to 44 and it would be better if we could have both of these routes in a frequency of 30-40 minutes during peak hours, atleast it can buy commuters' trust in these routes and make them avoid taking alternate routes and means of transport.",,24-Jul-16

However, the service was discontinued inconveniencing a lot of Hosa Road residents. These residents are now prey to the menacing autorickshaw drivers who fill their rickshaws with more people that safety allows.

The reason the last service was withdrawn was probably the service was irratic and not frequent. Therefore, I request you to restart the old service, possibly more frequently and if AC service is not feasible, then ordinary service. This service will help as I noted earlier.

We common people don't undersatnd ! U may ask any Bangalorian going for regular work using the BMTC. He is having either monthly or daily pass.Then where is the question of Collection? why the regular route Like Route no.80F/3/76D , the only bus going interior area of more than 2 Km.far from Main Road has to be cancelled with the reason of NO COLLECTION? It is so cilly that issuing BUS pass to everybody and collect money well in advance! And then SAY No Collection! No BUS !, No service! Really Cut throats!.

We would request you to provide a new bus route from Nelamangala Sondekuppa Bypass to Electronic City Wipro Gate.
We have commuters from Tumkur, Dabaspet, Nelamangala, Dasanapura, Kunigal, Solur, Makali, Arishinakunte, Madanayakanahalli,TCI & Madavara who travel on a daily basis to E-city. Currently the means of transport they use is mostly Private Cabs, Lorry, Canters etc.
Most of them are employed in Wipro, Infosys, HP, ABB, Tejas Networks, TCL, TUV, C.Dot, BOSCH, HCL, Siemens, Altimetry’s, Yokogawa, Cyient etc., all of them do a morning 8:30am to 6pm & 9am TO 6pmIST shift
Introducing this route will help all of us in many ways like:
·        Saves time

·        Hassel free travelling (Especially for Elderly & Pregnant ladies)

·        Using other means of transport like lorry, canters & Private Cab is not safe. By using BMTC we feel more secured and can travel with ease.

·        Using BMTC is economical for all class of people.

·        Reduces strain for people who change different buses to reach office or home.

Kindly request you to analyses the above mentioned situation and approve the request.
Note: we have people who also get down in different tolls like Kengeri, Kanakapura, Bannerughatta & Mysore Road. Introducing this route will help them as well.
